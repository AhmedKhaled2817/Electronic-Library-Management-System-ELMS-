Electronic Library Management System (ELMS)

The Electronic Library Management System (ELMS) is a software application designed to help libraries manage their books, members, and other activities in an organized and efficient way. Developed using C++, it makes use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to create a system that is both flexible and scalable.

Key Features
    Book Management
        Add Books: You can easily add new books to the library by specifying details like title, author, unique book ID, and price.
        View All Books: The system lets you see a list of all available books in the library.
        Search Books: You can search for books by their title, ID, or price range.
        Remove Books: The system allows you to delete books from the library if they are no longer needed. 
        
    Member Management
    
       Add Members: You can register new library members by entering their name, age, and a unique ID.
       Premium Members: Special benefits, such as discounts, are available for premium members.
       View Members: You can view the list of all registered members and their details.

    Additional Features

       Discount Calculation: For premium members, the system automatically calculates and applies discounts based on their membership duration and salary.
       Budget-Based Book Search: You can find books that fit within a specific budget using smart algorithms.
       Delete Items: The system allows you to remove books or members from the system with proper memory management. 

       Technical Details
          Object-Oriented Design:
              The system is built using key Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation, which makes the code modular and reusable.

        Dynamic Data Handling:
             The system uses vectors (a type of dynamic array in C++) to store books and members efficiently.

        Error Handling:
             The system includes proper error handling to manage incorrect inputs and avoid crashes.
             
        User-Friendly Interface:
             It offers an easy-to-use menu system that allows users to navigate the application with simple text-based commands.
